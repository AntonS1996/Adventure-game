# Adventure-game
Mini adventure game

You play for a character who wants to find the treasure in the mysterious house. It's not hard to guess that you can face some troubles inside. The main goal is to find the treasure in one room of the maze.

The character has a limited amount of life. Also you have some coins to buy items in the shop (you will find it in the maze). In the shop you can buy weapons, shield, food and drinks. You can find coins in the rooms of the maze and use them too.

In the maze you will meet some monsters which will attack you. So you should defeat them (or they will kill you).

This program is written on Qt.
